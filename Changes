1.05

This version is nearly identical to version 1.04, which is included in
the Perl core, but it removes the use of "our" in order to make the
code backwards compatible with Perl 5.00503.  It probably works with
earlier versions of Perl as well, but I don't have anything earlier
than 5.00503 installed.

Changes made from the core version include:

- Packaged for distribution on CPAN.

- Added an AUTHOR section to the docs.

- Clarified some points in the docs, particularly the fact that this
module uses the Unix epoch, regardless of platform.
